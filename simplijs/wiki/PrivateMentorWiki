See AboutWiki

This page, when referenced by AboutWiki, sets the wiki in "Mentor" mode, a mode where only "members" can can make permanent changes. Turning a "guest" into a "member" requires the approval of a  mentor, see LocalMentor.

Overall, this is like "locking" the door, making the place more private, whereas PrivateOpenWiki opens it

If closing you wiki this way is what you want, please click: DoMentorWiki (make sure you are a mentor first!)

Please note that PrivateClosedWiki closes a wiki even more
