         *Get the lowercase Y back*


SimpliWiki is !Free! This is great.

For commercial users, the "lowercase Y" thing is sometimes really annoying (WhyWhy), it does not look "serious" at all!

Premium services:
-----------------

There is a solution.

Send us a mail (at info@simpliwiki.com), we will restore the lowercase y for you, for free.

If, additionaly, you want a custom domain (ie wiki.yourcompany.com for example), please tell us about how much you're willing to spend per month. We're as reasonable as you are, we'll accept any decent offer (most offers are reasonable).

Yours,
