To find something in your wiki, use the "Go to page" box (at the bottom of most pages).

In that box you can enter:
- the full name of a page
- a portion of a page's name
- or anything that you remember from a page

The search looks for what you told in all the pages that were visited recently, looking in their name first or else in their content.

Note: * and ? are useful "wildcards" for "fuzzy" searches.

Example:
  DoSearch[help]
  DoSearch[todo]
