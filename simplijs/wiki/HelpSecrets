Secrets hide informations. Secrets may leak.

++Secret wikis

If you create a wiki with a name that you keep secret... it's a secret wiki!

You need an idea for a secret name? use secret.simpliwiki.com, a new wiki with a secret name will be created for you.

To hide a wiki even more, you can close it. Create a wiki and visit it's AboutWiki. In "closed" wikis, only "members" can access most pages.

++Secret pages

Some pages are secrets simply because their name is difficult to guess. In some cases, a stronger secret is required. See HelpMaps regarding "secret" pages that require a map.
