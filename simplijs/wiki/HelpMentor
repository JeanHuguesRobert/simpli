"Mentors" are special members of a wiki. They provide mentorship to the other members and visitors.

Typically there is at least one mentor in a wiki, it is the owner, the creator, the person in charge of the wiki.

The mentor of this wiki is usually described here: LocalMentor.

You are automaticaly a mentor when you create a wiki whose name is the name of your Twitter or Facebook account.

For other wikis, there is no mentors initially. See SimpliWikiDoc about that.

If you are a mentor, "Mentor" is mentionned on the top menu of your personal page, see YourPage.
