There are many ways to do things using SimpliWiki. Here are some recipes.

++Blogs

To build a blog, create a page for it and then add blog entry pages in inverse chronological order.

If needed, add a ThisComments mention to direct comments to another, sister, page.

See TimeNow & DateNow to insert a date more easely.

This wiki's blog is maybe BlogHere.

++To do lists

To build a "simple" to do list, create a page and list items as you would on paper. See also SortNow & ReverseNow to help you sort by priority.

To build a more complex to do list, create a TocXxxx page for it and then add an entry for each task.

This's wiki's to do list is maybe there: ToDoList.
Your to do list in this wiki is maybe there: YourToDoList.
