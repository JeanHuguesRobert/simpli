An invitation code is a secret, keep it secret.

If you have an invitation code, you can enter it on the HomePage page of the wiki your were invited to.

Invitation code starts with "Code". See also DraftCode & SignIn

If the invitation code is for a map (ie starts with Map instead of Code), enter in on your personnal page, see YourPage
