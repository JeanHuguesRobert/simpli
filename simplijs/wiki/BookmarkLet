To install a SimpliWiki "bookmarketlet" in your web browser, drag this to your browser bar:
WikifyIt

"bookmarklets" are small pieces of code that do something with the current page when you click on them.

SimpliWiki comes with a bookmarklet that makes it super easy to add content to your wikis.

When you visit a page and see some content that you want in a wiki, click on the "Wikify" bookmarklet for that wiki in your browser bar.

Note: you can install many SimpliWiki bookmarklets, to add content easely to many wikis. Add "WikifyIt" on any page to create a bookmarklet that will add content to that page versus adding content to YourPage.

Note2: too many bookmarklets in your browser bar? try marklets.com
