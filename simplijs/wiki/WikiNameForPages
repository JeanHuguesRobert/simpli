In this wiki, every page has a name. Instead of using a page number, the page is identified thanks to its name.

That name can be almost anything, but with a special "look".

Here are some simple guidelines:

- at least two words put together, each word capitalized, LikeThis
- or [two words] or more (free links)

Such names are valid WikiWords.

There are some "special" pages whose name starts with a special first word, see HelpPublicPages.

Note: if you prefer pages with "numbers" instead of names, you can use Page#1, Page#2, etc

Note2: #2010_01_17 is a valid wiki name, useful for tagging by date. Page2010_01_17 works too, for diaries maybe.
