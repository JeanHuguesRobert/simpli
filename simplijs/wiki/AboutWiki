You control the "openess" or "closeness" of your wiki. This is specially important when the name of your wiki is not a secret. See HelpPublicPages


Use of DoOpenWiki
  PrivateOpenWiki -- very open wikis

  In "very open" wikis, changes from both guests and members are "drafts" only if sent this way by the author, else the changes are permanent

  Beware: this means that *anybody* can change *anything* in open wikis!


Use of DocuratorWiki
  PrivatecuratorWiki -- less open wikis 

  "less open" wikis require curator approval to validate members and guest's changes

  Until their invitation code is stamped by a curator, changes from visitors are just "drafts". See InvitationCode and DraftCode

  Don't lock yourself out! Remember to register yourself as a curator before closing the door. See SimpliWikiDoc


Use of DoClosedWiki
  PrivateClosedWiki -- very closed wikis
