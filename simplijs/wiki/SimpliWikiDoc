There are 3 kinds of visitors:
- guests, anonymous or not
- members, aka "registered users"
- curators, who "own" wikis (aka administrators)

As a twitter user, you are automatically curator/owner of the wikis you create or whose name includes yours.

Otherwise, to claim ownership, register yourself, go to NewMember.

 ---------

++Guest visitors

- edit and then click "Send". Other visitors will see the change as a "draft" until some registered member "stamps" it
- use _some underline_ *strong* -strike- /italic/ !less! is "more"
- feel free to try, you can't break anything, wikis are robust by nature

+++To register 
  1- go to NewMember, edit to enter your name
  2- find your personal page (next to "bye")
  3- present yourself & ask for membership
  4- wait for approval by a curator
