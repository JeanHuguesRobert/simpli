Angular is an amazing tool to build ajax applications.

See AngularJs

The "hello" example is AngularHello

In an Angular page, one can use the SimpliWiki API to read/write pages in the wiki on behalf of the user, see HelpApi.

To customize the CSS, see CssStyles.

!Note! Please use a "prefetched: true" directive in Angular pages to make sure that the corresponding Do page doesn't render as a blank page when the wiki is restarted (applies to CSS pages too).

Note2: use DoListPrefetch to list prefetched pages.
