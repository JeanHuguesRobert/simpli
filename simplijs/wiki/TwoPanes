After you visit this page and then use "zoom out" ('a' in the top menu), the wiki's content gets displayed in two panes.

The pane on the left shows the "current page"

The pane on the right often shows the previous page. Sometimes it shows YourPage or the HomePage page.

When modifying a page, it shows how the page looked before you started modifying it.

To get back to the single pane mode, use the "zoom in" option ('A' in the top menu).

To stay with one pane after a "zoom out" ('a' in the top menu), please visit OnePane

To visit SimpliWiki and Google on two panes, see simpliwiki.com/with.google
