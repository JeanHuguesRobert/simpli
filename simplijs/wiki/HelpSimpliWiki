          Welcome to SimpliWiki

To use it, just try things, it is robust.

However, if you get lost, reading SimpliWikiDoc may help.

If you really get lost, ask your Localcurator.

If that's not an option, please contact the designers of SimpliWiki at info@simpliwiki.com, because something needs to be improved to make things here really simple to use for everybody. Thanks!
