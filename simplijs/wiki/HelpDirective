"directives" are special phrases that change the way things happen in your wiki.

Each page can have "directives" in it. The directives are sometimes shown in a section that starts with "---" (3 dashes).

For example, this page includes a "seeAlso" directive (and an empty cssStyle directive to make sure directives are shown).

The "meaning" of a directive depends on it's name (that comes before :) and it's value (that comes after :).

You can add directives and/or change a directive's value. Just edit the page as usual.
