Some pages include "directives", see HelpDirective.

Although their meaning can vary, here are general guidelines about some of the more frequent directives. Together with some pages that use them.

+++notify
This directive is a list of messages to display in the "notification" area of the page. Messages are separated with a dot + a space. This can be useful to provide links for navigation.

+++cssStyle
Either the name of a page with CSS code in it or the url (web address) of an external css file.

When specified in a page, this directive defines what style to apply to pages from now on. Note: use "cssStyle: no" to revert to the original style.

When specified in AboutWiki, it defines what style to apply to all pages (until some page says otherwise, if ever).
