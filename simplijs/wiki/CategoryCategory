This is sometimes the "category" of "category" pages.

Categories are a way of organizing pages.

"Tag" is another popular name for categories, see also TagTag, HashTag & #tag. In gmail tags are called "labels". "keyword" is sometimes another name for categories. There is more than one way to do it.

When a page includes the name of a category, it becomes a "categorized" page, aka a "tagged" page.

For example, #help could be the category/tag of help pages. See CategoryHelp (the actual tag).

How you name categories is up to you. CategoryCategory is the old way (academic), TagTag is more recent (casual), #tag is twitter style (short & convenient).

When you visit a "category" page, the "Links" section (shown at the bottom of the page) shows some recently visited pages that belongs to that category (ie pages where the category name appears).
