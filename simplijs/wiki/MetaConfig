PrivateConfig

To "close" this wiki, please click DoClosedWiki. This will change "PrivatecuratorWiki" (by default) into "PrivateClosedWiki" in the text above

 -----

You control the "openess" or "closeness" of your wiki. This is specially important when the name of your wiki is not a secret. See HelpPublicPages

Use of DoOpenWiki
  PrivateOpenWiki -- very open wikis

  In "open" wikis, changes from both guests and members are "drafts" only if sent this way by the author, else the change is permanent

  Beware: this means that *anybody* can change *anything* in open wikis!

Use of DocuratorWiki
  PrivatecuratorWiki -- less open wikis 

  "less open" wikis require curator stamped invitation codes to validate members and guest's changes

  Until their invitation code is stamped by a curator, changes from invited members are just "drafts", much like changes from guests. See InvitationCode and DraftCode

  Don't lock yourself out! Remember to register yourself as a curator before closing the door. See SimpliWikiDoc

Use of DoClosedWiki
  PrivateClosedWiki -- very closed wikis 

  If you want to close a wiki even more, mention PrivateClosedWiki. On such wikis, guests can only visit "Public" and "Guest" pages, ie regular pages can be visited by members of the wiki only


Valid content (all optional):
