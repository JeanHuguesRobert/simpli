SimpliWiki is not ready yet. Please don't put any sensitive information in it.

When it will be ready, SimpliWiki will provide multiple levels of security.

+++HTTPS

Using HTTPS, all the bits and data (sent by SimpliWiki or to it) are "encrypted". This is a fairly strong barrier.

Check your browser's address bar and look for "https" in it. If not present, it's not secure.

+++Passwords

When SimpliWiki stores a password, it stores it "encrypted". To decrypt the password, one needs a the "master key". The master key is stored in a protected file that nobody (but a thief) can access.

!!!As of today (jan 29 2011) no password at all are ever stored -- when this will change, the way the password are stored will be described here.
