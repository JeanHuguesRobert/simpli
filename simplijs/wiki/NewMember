To add a member to your wiki, please edit this page and provide the member's name where asked below.

If the member is on twitter, remember to add @. If the member is on facebook, add @ after the name (instead of before it). The name shall look like a valid WikiNameForUsers.

A new "User" page will then automatically be created. It is the "personal" page of the new member in your wiki, much like your own YourPage personal page. Only the new member (and you) can access this page.

Note: if the new member should be a co-owner, please add "Mentor" before the name.

++To claim ownership
Edit this page and provide your name where asked below. Then visit YourPage and bookmark the "SECRET!" link at the bottom. You can now visit AboutWiki (only owners can).
