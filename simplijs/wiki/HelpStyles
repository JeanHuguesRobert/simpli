With SimpliWiki, what you type is what you see, with some style applied sometimes.

There are few "hidden codes". This makes it easier to "learn by example"

*Bold*       - makes something more visible
!more!       - even more visible !!!
(details)    - less visible
/italic/     - / leans the way italics do
_under line_ - _ is called "the underscore"
"a quote"    - self explanatory
-strike-     - one word at a time -not two-

 -----

Slightly less easy to learn:
+ Big title
++ title
+++ small title
++++ even smaller
+++++ no so much visible
!!! makes a difference

For gurus:

 1# ordered (space hash prefix)
 2# list

 - Some paragraph (space dash prefix)
with content
on multiple lines

 1. nested (works with star, dash & dot)
   1# with
   2# numbered
   3# items
     - and more
 maybe right aligned > >
 < < or centered > >
   4# maybe
 2. with nested content
over
and over

For extreme gurus: CssStyles

And that's enough! You may want to practice in the SandBox
